## 前言
在Linux上的R中install.packages时，经常会出现窗口抓取失败的情况，如下：
```R
> install.packages("ggplot2")
Installing package into ‘/home/luna/Desktop/Software/RSoft/lib64/R/library’
(as ‘lib’ is unspecified)
--- Please select a CRAN mirror for use in this session ---
Error in structure(.External(.C_dotTclObjv, objv), class = "tclObj") :
  [tcl] grab failed: window not viewable.
> 
```
意思是，窗口抓取失败，这是因为调用 TCLTK 窗口时，窗口因为某些原因（如使用ssh工具连接linux）无法弹出，所以出现错误无法选择mirror。

## 解决方案
在install.packages之前，先输入chooseCRANmirror(graphics=FALSE)，选择合适的mirror后再安装：
```R
> chooseCRANmirror(graphics=FALSE)
